<b>Note</b>: please ensure the completed JSON follows the schema outlined in [./json/schema/l2-token-list-schema.json](./json/schema/l2-token-list-schema.json). Make sure to add the token following alphabetical order of the `symbol` field.


3. Commit your changes and push your branch.

<b>Note</b>: Only commit the list file. Do not modify the schema or the templates.


4. Go to https://github.com/ConsenSys/linea-token-list/pulls and create a new PR. Make sure to set the base branch as `main`.

A GitHub Actions workflow will automatically verify the integrity of your JSON. If the check passes, validators will review the new list. If all the information are correct, they will approve the token addition.

In case of a failing check, refer to the error message in the [Actions](https://github.com/ConsenSys/linea-token-list/actions) tab. Make necessary modifications and try again.

## How to validate the new Token (for validators)

As a validator, you should:

1. Copy the JSON version template from [./json/templates/linea-goerli-token-version-template.json](./json/templates/linea-goerli-token-version-template.json).
2. Fill out the copied template with the new version's information.
3. Add the completed JSON to the versions array in [./json/linea-goerli-token-shortlist.json](./json/linea-goerli-token-shortlist.json).

Example:

```
{
  [...]
  "versions": [
    // Append the JSON here
  ]
}
```

4. Commit the changes and approve the PR.

Happy contributing!
