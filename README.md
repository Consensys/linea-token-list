<b>Additional guidelines</b>:
* Please ensure the completed JSON follows the schema outlined in [./json/schema/l2-token-list-schema.json](./json/schema/l2-token-list-schema.json).
* Make sure to add the token following alphabetical order of the `symbol` field.
* Update the `updatedAt` (and potentially `createdAt`) fields for the file and the token
* Update the file version:
    * Increase `patch` when modifying information of an existing token
    * Increase `minor` when modifying adding a new token
    * Increase `major` when changing the structure of the file

3. Commit your changes and push your branch.

<b>Note</b>: Only commit the list file. Do not modify the schema or the templates.

4. Go to https://github.com/ConsenSys/linea-token-list/pulls and create a new PR. Make sure to set the base branch as `main`.

A GitHub Actions workflow will automatically verify the integrity of your JSON. If the check passes, validators will review the new list. If all the information are correct, they will approve the token addition.

In case of a failing check, refer to the error message in the [Actions](https://github.com/ConsenSys/linea-token-list/actions) tab. Make necessary modifications and try again.

Happy contributing!
