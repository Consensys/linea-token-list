Action: add / update / remove token (keep those that applies)
Context / rational:

PR checklist:
- [ ] I've verified and published the contract source
- [ ] I've kept the token list in alphabetical order based on token symbol
- [ ] I've updated the `updatedAt` (and potentially `createdAt`) fields
- [ ] I've updated the list version number as per README instruction
